            <h1>THE HOUSE</h1>
            <h2>About a week ago my Grandfather decided to give me his old vacation house in the countryside.He always planned on giving it to me and thanks to this new horrific and contagious virus spreading throughout the world this is a perfect time. Most businesses were forced to shut down by the government to prevent its spread. I use to work at an old tattoo shop called "Inked Out" over on Merrick in Queens. Rocky was confident he could bring back the shop but I don't believe him. The shop was already in a pretty sorry state before the pandemic, Rocky didn't tell me but I figured out on my own that he took out several loans to help with his wives' medical bills. The old man's a great guy. I'd stay and help but being the idiot with a broom there is probably not much I can do. Should I have stayed? Fuck... it doesn't matter now, I'm 5 minutes away.</h2>
